- To do :
  - [x] Hero slide with text silhouette
     - [ ] have left time so will make loading page
  - [x] add eyes
  - [x] come up with game idea
        
         Play as a leopard, mastering the hunt in darkness, daylight, mountains, rivers, and open ground.
         More of a pixelated game with levels and leopard strenght unocking along the way
  - [ ] come up with game logic
  - [x] see if unity can be attached here
    - [ ] turns out i can use webgl for this (so now build graphics for it)
  - [ ] overall better performance
